                    Hello, I designed and built this personal portfolio website from scratch using HTML, CSS, 
                    and JavaScript to showcase my web development skills and for people to get a chance to get to 
                    know more about me from my education, interests, and goals.
                </p>
                <p>This project has helped me refine my skills in HTML and CSS, creating a portfolio project that 
                    reflects and captures me. From selecting specific colors, fonts, and images. Including Q & A 
                    section where you get to know more about me, a contact page where it features links to where 
                    you can reach me, and a project page where you can see different projects I have done in the 
                    programming languages of HTML/CSS/JavaScript, Python, Java, and Swift. In each programming 
                    language project section you get more deep details of how I create projects, my inspirations 
                    for them, and screenshots of their code, or wireframes of these projects.
                </p>
                <p>I hope you enjoy and explore around!</p>

                <p>Inspiration for Project?</p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for my portofolio website, was from months of wanting to create a 
                    portfolio website that felt like me and it reflected that the moment someone opened 
                    my portfolio website. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I was able to do accomplish this with this portofolio because I 
                    let my creavity flow and allowing myself to be open to changing things here and there 
                    without limiting myself to the original wireframes or ideas that no longer felt right. 
                    I loved the way my ideas and design of this project came out, because it truly reflect me in a way.
                </p>

                <p>Features I would like to add?</p>
                <p>
                    I would like to update the project's page.  
                    I am currently learning JavaScript and when I have developed further my ability
                     to code in this programming language, I would like to update the layout of this 
                     the project's page and have it display all of my projects and to have a filter at 
                     the top of the projects, so users can select a button of the programming languages 
                     they want to see and for those projects to only appear and the others to be hidden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am currently working on adding more projects to this site, so you can see more of my work.

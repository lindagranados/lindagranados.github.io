                    A web-based social music discovery platform that integrates a music search engine with a recommendation system 
                    to enable playlist creation, supports playlist sharing, song and album ratings, community-driven discovery, and 
                    personalized music recommendations.

                <p>
                    This web application was designed for users to discover music and playlists with similar styles, or to create 
                    and share their own playlists for others to listen and enjoy.

                <p>How did this project idea come about?</p>
                <p>
                    The inspiration for this project started when I was trying to find music that was similar to a song I was 
                    listening to at the time and I couldn't find one. I have always struggled to find similar songs/music to one 
                    song that I would find and absolutely love. So, that night I had the idea to create a platform that helps 
                    people discover more music with the same vibe or energy as songs they already love. During my time planning 
                    and developing the code for this project, I came up with more features and ideas on what I want this platform 
                    to accomplish for users.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides being a platform that helps people find music based on a song they love, I want to build a sense of 
                    community. Therefore, I want this platform to be a place where people can share their love for music in a 
                    variety of ways. Whether that is by helping recommend similar songs for others to listen and enjoy or giving 
                    a platform for people that love to create playlists to post their unique playlists that transport their 
                    listeners to their uniquely curated spaces. 
                </p>

                <p>Features I would like to add?</p>
                <p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to add some social, personalization, and discovery features to this platform. 
                    For the social features, I would like to include a community-driven, five-star rating feature on songs and 
                    albums and possibly a comment section on songs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I would like to add additional rating scales on songs and albums, one of the rating scales to be based on 
                    agreement that people have on recommending that song based on the song/music you listened to and another 
                    one to be based on quality rating (community average) more based on if the song has lyrics that resonates 
                    well with the listeners or if they enjoy the vocals, etc. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the personalization and discovery features, I want the platform to be able to give users every week a 
                    song suggestion that others have recommended based on the music they heard recently or last week. Or give 
                    them a surprise mix every month of music they would like based on the content they listen to for the month 
                    or a combination of music they have liked for the month, etc. Overall, I want to work towards creating more 
                    original and creative playlists for people to enjoy and share with others. Since I enjoy music and would like 
                    to spread this love of art to others all while feeling part of a community.

                <p>Collab project or solo?</p>
                <p>
                    This was a solo project, just me and my creativity. At times as well as assistance from AI.

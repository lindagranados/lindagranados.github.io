                    <p>
                        My name is Linda Granados and I am a curious and self-driven computer science student at the University of South Florida with an interest in web development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My interest in computer science came from a keyboarding class in 6th grade. I remember taking this class and loving the skills I was learning and being completely fascinated with computers and technology.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7 years later, I am still passionate about technology and computers and continue to be completely amazed by the advancements being made by this ever changing and evolving field.

                It is all thanks to a keyboarding class I took in 6th grade.
                <br><br>I can remember taking this course and loving everything I was learning about computers and technology. I learned how to type pretty quickly, sometimes without even looking down at the keyboard with minimal errors. I also learned about the basic parts of a computer and how all the little parts do a function that makes a computer run.
                <br><br>I loved all of the information I was learning, so much that the following years I decided to use any elective credits I had to be about computers and technology. I went on to take Digital Information Technology, Introduction to Computers, Cybersecurity, Foundations of Programming, etc.
                <br><br>Throughout my time taking those courses, I realized that I was happiest and it was something that always made me feel excited to learn and I loved to spend my time applying the concepts I was being taught into working code.
                <br><br>So, I decided to major in computer science.

                I am currently working on earning my Full-Stack Engineer certificate on Codecademy. I am currently learning about Grid and Responsive Design and will then move on to learn JavaScript. I am also building projects as I go, my focus right now is on building projects in frontend, where my focus is providing users the best experience possible. I enjoy being able to design projects, develop the code and fix bugs every now and then.
